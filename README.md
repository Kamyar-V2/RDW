## Description
The Reward-Driven Workflow for Image Analysis in Electron Microscopy (RDW) introduces a novel approach in
scientific research, harmonizing expert guidance with straightforward algorithms to refine image analysis. 
This method utilizes a Reward Function combined with Bayesian Optimization
to ensure that the analysis process aligns precisely with human-defined objectives. 
By employing RDW, analysts can tailor and enhance their image analysis protocols in real-time, securing outcomes that
meet predefined experimental goals.
